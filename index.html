<h1>Pre-work Phase 1</h1>
<p>Git (on my computer) is version control software that we run on our computer.</p>
<p>GitHub (on the web) is a REMOTE web application that works with Git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
<p>ddc-web-student.cnm.edu (the server) is the bootcamp SERVER that runs our code.</p>
<p>We add and commit our code to Git on our computer</p>
<p>We PUSH our code from our computer to GitHub.</p>
<p>We DEPLOY our code from our computer to the bootcamp server.</p>
<p>DEPLOY and PUSH are different!</p>
